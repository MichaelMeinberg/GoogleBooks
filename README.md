# MMGoogleBookSearch

This app was done as a job challenge and it's job is to search the Google library of books by title.  The app was written in Swift and follows MVVM archictechual pattern.

In order to get this app to run you will need to enter in your own GOOGLE BOOKS API KEY.  These are unique to the user (if this were a real end user app, I would have added a login section to authenicate the user). 

To get the key, follow this video:

To enter the key, open the Keys.swift file in the project.  And update the variable:

    static let GOOGLEBOOKSAPIKEY = ""

They key looks something like this (this one is not valid): "AIza556TTYT998K55154TR339-Oa"
